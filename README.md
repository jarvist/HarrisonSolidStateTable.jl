An implemention of Walter A. Harrison's tight-binding method, with parameters as described in his Solid State Table. 

See Walter A. Harrison, Electronic structure and the properties of solids. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Electronic-Structures-Properties-Solids-Physics/dp/0486660214

This book enables, by the use of an empirical Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) minimal basis and tight-binding Hamiltonian, to "calculate nearly any property of any solid, using a hand-held calculator".

Strangely there don't appear to be any extant software packages or libraries to enable this! This is an initial attempt to remedy this lack.
